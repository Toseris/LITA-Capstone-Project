### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
Data cleaning and preparation is a crucial first step in data analysis, ensuring that data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis;
1. Handling Missing Values
2. Removing Duplicates
3. Validation and Consistency Checks
4. Documenting Data Cleaning Process

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA involves the examination of data to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and check assumption. It also involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions 
  about the Data such as ;
- What is the size of the dataset (number of rows and columns)?
- What are the monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales trends? Is there an observable upward or downward trend over time?
- Are there any duplicate rows or records that need to be removed?
